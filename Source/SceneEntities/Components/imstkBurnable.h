/// damage state that controls when a cell gets deleted and state data for visualization. This is currently defined as [0,1] where 0 is
///  no damage and value >= 1 deletes the cell. The visual data is purely for visualization, and can be used as the user desires.
///  The model that changes the state is defined by the burning object.
